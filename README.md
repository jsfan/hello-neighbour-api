# Hello Neighbour API
Backend for the Hello Neighbour app started at COVID-19 Global Church Hackathon.
The [prototype](https://devpost.com/software/hello-neighbour-he4ojl) won the hackathon's [Community Award](https://medium.com/faithtech/covid-19-global-church-hackathon-results-e41b23803c28).

This prototype (available [here](https://github.com/UpstreamCode/interconnect-backend)) was written in Python/Flask.
After the hackathon we decided to switch the API to Go and this repository holds the new code base.
